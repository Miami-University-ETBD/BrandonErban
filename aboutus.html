            <h2><u> How We Started</u></h2>
            <p>Green Earth was founded with a simple yet powerful mission:<strong> To bring the beauty and benefits of plants into everyday life.</strong> Our journey began in a small greenhouse, where a group of passionate plant lovers saw the need for a business that not only sells plants but educates people on their benefits.</p>
            <p>We started by attending farmer's markets, offering locally sourced, air-purifying plants to our community. As demand grew, so did our vision. In just a few years, Green Earth evolved into an online store, reaching plant enthusiasts nationwide. <em>Our goal has always been to make plant ownership easy, rewarding, and sustainable</em></p>

                <h2>Why Plants Matter</h2>
                <p><strong>Plants</strong> are the foundation of life on Earth, offering oxygen, nourishment, and medicinal benefits. They <em>purify the air</em>, regulate climates, and serve as habitats for countless species.</p>
                <p>Studies show that having plants indoors reduces stress, boosts mood, and enhances productivity. Whether at home, in the office, or outdoors, greenery significantly improves our well-being and creates a more sustainable world</p>
                <p>Beyond aesthetics, plants contribute to our health by filtering toxins from the air and providing essential nutrients in our diets. Many plants also have medicinal properties that have been used for centuries in natural remedies. Incorporating plants into daily life is a simple yet powerful way to promote overall well-being</p>
